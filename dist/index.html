                <p class="review-text--1">At its core, Insomniac Games’ new adventure strives to make you feel like Spider-Man. And, thankfully, Marvel's Spider-Man on PS4 succeeds at 
                    nearly every swing across Manhattan’s rooftops. I was left delighted at nearly every step of its 15-hour adventure thanks to a surprisingly deep tale that mines the 
                    plights of both Spider-Man and Peter Parker to great emotional success. Underpinning that engrossing narrative is an excellent set of webswinging mechanics, 
                    which -- combined with fun gadgets and plenty of puns -- makes for thrilling action in both the massive setpieces and in the quiet, confined corridors of tense 
                    sequences. Insomniac’s first foray into the realm of Marvel superheroes is a continually exciting adventure whose open world and combat are only occasionally 
                    caught up in a web of overly familiar trappings.
                </p>
                <p class="review-text--2">
                    Swinging around feels, quite simply, spectacular. There’s a small learning curve, but after getting comfortable with the basics, it’s nearly effortless 
                    to make Spider-Man look graceful in every swing, leap, and lunge. And man does it feel good to find the right mix of jumping, crawling, web zipping, and wall 
                    running.
                </p>
                <h2 class="heading-2 section-review__heading">Doing What a Spider Can</h2>
                <p class="review-text--3">
                    And, happily, no aspect of New York’s architecture can really stop Spider-Man. Discovering how a powerful, but nimble, Spider-Man tackles fire escapes, 
                    both vertically and horizontally, or watching him slip through the metal grating of a water tower is endlessly entertaining. His animations are so detailed 
                    that no matter the obstacle, I got the sense that I could truly do whatever a Spider-Man could.
                    That was surprisingly true of indoor locations, too. The main story missions often took me into large-scale interiors, sometimes for light puzzle solving, 
                    and occasionally for stealthy takedown scenarios. For anyone who’s played the Batman: Arkham franchise, the framework is largely the same: enter a room, avoid 
                    being detected, and use a mix of gadgets and (relatively) quiet web takedowns to take down the crowd.
                </p>
                <h2 class="heading-2 section-review__heading">Concrete Jungle</h2>
                <p class="review-text--4">
                        Spider-Man’s New York is an absolute blast to swing around, in part thanks to how gorgeous the shiny skyscrapers of the city look. 
                        Spider-Man does have its graphical hiccups — for example, the faces of Peter and other key characters are spectacularly animated while less notable characters 
                        are flat and often out of sync with dialogue. But its New York City is undeniably gorgeous, particularly on a PS4 Pro. Swinging around at dusk as the calm oranges 
                        of the setting sun hit the reflective glass of New York’s skyscrapers at just the right angle evoked some of the most calming, zen-like gameplay sessions I’ve 
                        experienced in awhile.
                        Marvel’s Spider-Man doesn’t offer a a 1:1 recreation of New York City, but most of the key landmarks -- including my old apartment -- are recreated faithfully. 
                        Neighborhoods have distinct enough character to be discernible as I swung from one to the next. Yes, certain aspects of the city, like water towers or certain 
                        building fronts, can start to feel repetitive. But Insomniac has done a pretty great job of capturing the city’s look with the sheen I’d expect for a world full of 
                        superheroes and super science.
                </p>
                <h2 class="heading-2 section-review__heading">Slow-Spinning Redemption</h2>
                <p class="review-text--5">
                    Thankfully, the story consistently delivers that sense of weight and impact, albeit after a somewhat slow start. 
                    Insomniac’s Spider-Man is one who has a history in this world, and it feels earned thanks to smart integration of familiar villains rather than throwing them 
                    at the screen for the sake of fan service. The script allows time for the central villains (and Peter’s relationship to them) to believably develop, making 
                    for some emotionally powerful scenes toward the end that definitely had me misty eyed on a couple of occasions.
                </p>
                <h2 class="heading-2 section-review__heading">Conclussion</h2>
                <p class="review-text--6">I wanted Marvel’s Spider-Man on PS4 to make me feel like Spider-Man: To sail between the highrises of New York City, to 
                    nimbly web up hordes of enemies, and tussle with familiar, animal-themed villains. Insomniac Games’ first foray into the world of Marvel handily delivers 
                    on all of that. But what I didn’t expect from Spider-Man was to come away feeling just as fulfilled to have inhabited the life of Peter Parker. Aside from a few 
                    odd pacing issues, which momentarily took me out of the experience of being a superhero, and a world of optional missions that don’t always quite live up to the 
                    heft of the main story, Insomniac has delivered a Spider-Man story that both surprised and delighted me, coupled with gameplay that made me feel like Spider-Man 
                    nearly every step of the way. The Wall Crawler’s open world doesn’t consistently deliver the thrilling moments of its main campaign, but the foundation laid here 
                    is undoubtedly a spectacular one.
